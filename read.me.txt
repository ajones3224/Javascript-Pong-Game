      My project is a 2 player pong game. My goal for the project was to be able to have
    a 2 player pong game that keeps track of the score and could determine a winner.
    I was able to achieve that goal and have a basic pong game that works. The
    toughest part of the assignment was getting the ball to bounce of the paddles. That took
    me the longest to code in javascript. Overall the balls can bounce back and forth between
    the paddles.It updates the score when the ball past the paddles and hits the borders behind
    the paddles.
      Some of the problems with the programming is that the ball would glitch when hitting
      the paddles. Also the ball would glitch when it was moving to fast.If I had more time
      I would try to make the game able to play with 1 player. I would also try to add levels
      to the game, so that more balls appear as you go up in levels. I would also try to create
      a mode where you would have to keep the balls in play as long as you can. The longer you
      keep them in play the higher the score.
